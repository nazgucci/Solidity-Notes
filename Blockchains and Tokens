sha 256 hash - data in does not determine legth - keeps same string length regardless

Block -
-block #
-Nonce #
-Data
-hash

Nonce is the value miners solve for given hash and block #

Blockchain
-block #
-Nonce #
-Data
-previous
-hash

Genesis Block - 1st block - prev points to a block that doesnt exist. 000000...

Distributed Blockchain
Peer A
Blockchain
-block #
-Nonce #
-Data
-previous
-hash

Peer B
Blockchain
-block #
-Nonce #
-Data
-previous
-hash

the latest hash in the most current block encompasses all previous hashes of all previous blocks
The peers review eachothers block hash and if a peer has a different hash it is booted from participating

Tokens
-Block #
-Nonce #
-Tx Data
-Prev: hash of last block
-Hash: current hash of current block

Nonce: A "number used once" to find the "solution" to the blockchain problem.
-Eth: It is also used to define the transaction number for an account/address

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) (BTC & ETH)
- a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography
Private Key:
Only known to the key holder, used to "sign" transactions

1. private key is created
2. public key is generated to give out and the world can see it
3. private key is used as a "password" to digitally sign transactions
4. public key is seen as the person who signed and can be verified by others

Signatures (sign) - you can sign with private key to get message signature but private key cannot be derived from Message Signature
-Message
-Private Key
-Mesage Signature

Signatures (verify)
-Message
-Public Key
-Signature

Transaction (sign)
Message:
-$-From:addr->addr
-Private Key
--Sign--
-Message Signature Generated

Transaction (verify)
Message:
-$-From:addr->addr
-Signature
--Verify

Private key ||| > public key > Address

Ethereum Wallet address:
-Public key hashed with ECDSA
-A dirivitive of the public key
